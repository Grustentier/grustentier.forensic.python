# grustentier.forensic.python
In this repo you will find some simple python scripts, which can be helpful for the analysis of stacked images (video frames) they resulting from video splitting.
Such scripts can be helpful for changing image properties to support the visual-kognitiv assesment of shapes and geometries of objects shown in a single videoframe or the whole corresponding video.

Furthermore, here are some scripts available for post-processing of data they coming from known frameworks like:
- YOLO (https://pypi.org/project/yolov5/)
- OpenPose (https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)
- ...
to support object detection in mass video data and to support the assessment of estimated poses for further anthropometric analysis.

In future, this repo will be updated as soon as possible with scripts from other areas of digital forensics.
